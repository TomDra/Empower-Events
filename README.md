Welcome to your repo for COM2027, Group 19!
=====================================================

Feel free to change this README.

Getting started
---------------

Before you get started, you should update your com2027.yml file with your team members and project details. This will appear at [your static site](https://csee.pages.surrey.ac.uk/com2027/2023-24/Group19).

You have two branches created for you, `trunk` and `release`. The final commit on `release` will be marked.

Commits must be merged into `release` using a merge request, which requires two approvals. Force-pushing is disabled for both branches, as this can destroy your work. Only `trunk` can be merged into `release`.

You may develop directly on `trunk`, although it is recommended that you branch from `trunk` and submit merge requests (or merge directly onto the branch). How you use `trunk` is up to your team.
